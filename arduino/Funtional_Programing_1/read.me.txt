In this code we have determined the values of morseDash and morseDot, setting with intervals how long each of these lasts, simplifying the previous code to make it easier to read.

We have determined each of the letters with morseDash and morseDot and put it in the loop so that it plays indefinitely.

It is basically a graphical simplification of the previous one.
