In this code what we have done is that an LED reproduces a name in Morse code over and over again indefinitely, and each time it does so it will finally have a delay of 2000 milliseconds.

In conclusion we have taken the same intervals as in Blink_Variation-06 and Functional_Programing_1 and we have put them in this code.

The objective in this code is to simplify the previouse one.
