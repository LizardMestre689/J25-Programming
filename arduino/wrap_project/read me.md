## Final Project
---
In this project we have to create a code that Echo when you write something through serial is going to reply the same command just to be sure that the command has been sent properly. Write a line in morse code if you write "m: " or "morse " for the command and the line after will be sent as morse code. If the command is correct send a cooking recipee of the dish of your choice. Play (or stop) a song.

During the proces of this code at the end I had some problemas traing to stop the music, and at the end I cloud not achive this goal.
