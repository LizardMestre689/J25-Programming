In this code we have a configuration that sends and outputs to the LED, this output tells the arduino that the LED on pin 13 has to be on for 2000 milliseconds and then it has to turn off for 1000 milliseconds. This whole process will only be carried out when the Arduino starts working since it is in the setup.

Then it will repeat the following code indefinitely, the LED will be on for 500 milliseconds and off for 500 milliseconds, over and over again.
