To command we are going to determine that the Interval (dotDuration will be equal to 500).

In the setup we put that we are going to be acting on the LED_BUILTIN.

This code is based on recreating a name in Morse code using the LED as responsible for following the code and Morse code indications. In the loop we have each letter of a name, and within each letter we have the exact indications (in dots intervals) so that the Arduino LED is able to represent it in Morse code and that a human is able to understand it, this code will be repeated indefinitely.
