In this code we implement a new function in the void morseBlink(), now we implement an "int NumberOfDots" in the parentheses. In order not to have to put a dashduration and simplify the terms we use. Within the parentheses we will enter the number of times the LED has to shine to represent the letter of the name that we are representing on the Arduino.

In the loop we do exactly the same, repeating the established name an infinite number of times.
