This code is based on creating a recipe, in this case a Spanish tortilla. (WITH ONION)

The loop will respond with a ("You have input: " + input) if we have written something and we have put this, otherwise the code would respond with spaces infinitely (input != " ").

If we write (cook) the code will go to the (decide) section.

Afterwards we go to the cook section, this section checks if we have the necessary ingredients and if we have them it will respond with ("you have a Spanish Omelette") and then it will subtract the ingredients that we have used.

Finally, we can replenish what we have not spent by writing the missing ingredient, writing (input=="potato").
