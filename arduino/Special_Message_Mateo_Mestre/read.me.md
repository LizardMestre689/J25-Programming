The objective of this code is to make the Arduino write us a drawing with characters from the keyboard.

First it will tell us (This is a Special Message), then it will write line by line the characters to represent a 2D figure, in my case I have chosen a classic mustang for this code, this will be repeated indefinitely, and each time it completes a loop This will have a delay of 2000 milliseconds.
