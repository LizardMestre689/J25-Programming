**Function in programing**
---

Functions are subsets of code defined to be executed when they are called, they can have parameters that can change the behavior of the function (or not). And they can have a return (or not).  


**Function syntaxy's in C++** 
---

Definition: 

- Return type (void none)---->Void name of the function (parameter inside) {Cod Code} 
- We cannot define a duration inside the definition of another function 

Calling a function: 

- Name of the function ();
- Has to be the exact same name (case sensitive) 


**Examples of calling function:** (All are defined in a library) arduino.cpp 
---

- Digital write (int pin, 1 or 0) 

- Delay (long/int) 

- Pin Mode (Pin, mode)

**Examples of defining functions:** 
---

Void setup (no parameter) { 

Void loop () { 

Boilerplate---> code difficult to read difficult to maintain 

Digital wright (13, H) 

D (_) 

DW (13, L) 

D (_) 

Serial:  

Object-> type of complex valuable 

Handles communication through serial 

Talks and listens to the PC through USB 

**How?** 

- Serial. begin (9600); 

- Serial. println (‚Äúresp‚Äù) 

 

**Variables:**
---

Int dotDuration= i 

Variable is a place in memory where we can store data and it‚Äôs **identified** so we can store it. 

Variables can have **types**, to specifically how much memory do they need and the possibilities they can offer. 

In C++ and other highly types of programing languages, types are **mandatory** to be specified. 

Highly types Programing languages (C++,‚Ä¶) 

Common primitive variables:	----->	Objects (complex type of variables) 



**üß±Building blocksüß±**
---

Numbers (C++):  

int-numeral numbers ut to 32000 

Long- Bigger numbers 

8int/ 8uint: less memory/ less number 

Loat- decimal numbers 

String---> String 

Chat---> Name 

Booleans---> True/False 

 
**Syntax of variable in C++:**
---

Declaration:

Int 			dotDuration 		; 

Type of variable		Name/Identified	only 
 
**Assignment:** 

dotDurarion  =    500 

  Name		  Equal   valve 

 
**Common assignment: C++** 
---

- a= a+1; = a++; 

- b=b-1; = b--;  
 
**Naming connection:**
---


Variables cannot have spaces. 

We usually use camel cases 

Objects -> start with a capital Serial 

Variables that do not change the value

üêçSREAMING_SANKE_CASEüêç

In C++ you can enforce it: 

LUYI=4; ---> makes a compiling error‚ùå 

- ü•ôKebab-case ü•ô

Serial: --> Its and object; -- First letter  

We are going to use method inside. 

Compilers or uploader: Is syntax error, or the code doesn't work. The Arduino is not connected. 

Arduino haves 6 meanings: The fiscal one, the CPU of the Arduino, the soft wear, toolchain of the Arduino that will read and translate   

Compiling: They take the code and translate it to machine code to be able to read it. 

Constants is a specific think  

A variable can change ü§® 

Interpreting: The code, it read line by line and resumed line by line

```C++
// First Example

int a = 200;
int b = 100;
int c = 50;

void setup() {
 b = a;
 a = a + 200;
}

void loop() {
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTING, HIGH);
 delay(b); //200
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTING, LOW);
 delay(c); //50
}

// Second example

int a = 200;
int b = 100;
int c = 50;

void setup() {
 a = a - 50;//a = 150
 b = a; // b = 150
 a = a + 200; // a = 150 + 200 = 350
 c = a + b; // c = 350 + 150 = 500
}

void loop() {
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTING, HIGH);
 delay(b); // b  = 150
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTING, LOW);
 delay(c); // c = 500
}

// Third example
C++
int a = 200;
int b = 100;
int c = 50;

void setup() {
 x = b + c *2;
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTING, OUTPUT);
 delay(c);
 b = b - 100;
 c = b + 100
 a = a + 200; 
 c = a + b; 
}

void loop() {
} 
```

## ‚òùÔ∏èVocabulary‚òùÔ∏è

- Pseudocode: Is a description of the steps in an algorithm using a mix of conventions of programming languages with informal, usually self-explanatory, notation of actions and conditions.
- Parameter: Is a special kind of variable used in a function to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the function.
- Array: Is a collection of items, or data, stored in contiguous memory locations, also known as database systems
- Implementation: is a realization of a technical specification or algorithm as a program, software component, or other computer system through computer programming and deployment.
Extract a method: Its extracting from a place code that is to complex and we transform it into a separate function in order to make it less complex.
- Pseudorandom: A pseudorandom number is a number generated in a process that appears to produce random numbers, but does not actually do so, they are generated sequentially with a deterministic algorithm
- Iteration: repeat things, but always on different ways

# **Deveres de DNI**
---
**DNI**

The National Identity Document serves as a citizen's identity number in many Spanish-speaking nations. The DNI's logic uses a particular validation algorithm and usually consists of a numerical character followed by a letter.

**Numeric Part:**

- The numeric part of the DNI is typically 8 digits long.

- It uniquely identifies an individual.

**Letter:**

- The letter in the DNI is a checksum or verification digit.

- It is calculated based on the numeric part to ensure the validity of the DNI.

**¬∑ Calculation of the Letter:**

- Take the numeric part of the DNI and calculate the remainder when dividing it by 23.
- The remainder corresponds to a specific letter in a predefined sequence.
- The sequence is usually "TRWAGMYFPDXBNJZSQVHLCKE," where each letter corresponds to a specific value.

**For example:**

0: T, 1: R ,2: W, 3: A, 4: G, 5: M, 6: Y, 7: F, 8: P, 9: D, 10: X, 11: B, 12: N, 13: J, 14: Z, 15: S, 16: Q, 17: V, 18: H, 19: L, 20: C, 21: K, 22: E.

**Validation Process:**

To validate a DNI, you can follow these steps:

Take the numeric part of the DNI and calculate the remainder when dividing it by 23.
Compare the calculated remainder with the corresponding letter in the predefined sequence.
If they match, the DNI is considered valid

# **Array String methods**
---



**Array ü™¢Stringsü™¢**

A string is a class that defines objects that are represented as a stream of characters. Most of the programs require to work with texts employ strings in the case of strings, memory is allocated dynamically. More memory can be allocated at run time on demand. As no memory is reallocated, no memory is wasted.

---
- In C++, we can work with strings in a variety of ways. Reversing, concatenating, or sending anything as an argument to a function are a few examples.

--- 

- Some of the most common examples are:

## Important functions supported by String class

- append(): This function appends a part of a string to another string.
- assign():This function assigns a partial string.
- at(): This function obtains the character stored at a specified location.
- begin(): This function returns a reference to the start of the string.
- capacity(): This function gives the total element that can be stored.
- compare(): This function compares a string against the invoking string.
- empty(): This function returns true if the string is empty.
- end(): This function returns a reference to the end of the string.
- erase(): This function removes characters as specified.
- find(): This function searches for the occurrence of a specified substring.
- length(): It gives the size of a string or the number of elements of a string.
- swap(): This function swaps the given string with the invoking one.


---

## Important Constructors

---

- String(): This constructor is used for creating an empty string.
- String(const char *str): This constructor is used for creating string objects from a null-terminated string.
- String(const string *str): This constructor is used for creating a string object from another string object.

---

##‚ùóImportant Concepts‚ùó
-- 

- Collection of elements: Arrays in C++ are collections of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Index and value: An element of an array will always have an index between 0 and n-1 being n: the length of the array.
- Lenght: Size of an array; number of elements.
- Fixed size: Once declared, the size of an array cannot be changed during runtime.
- Indexing: Elements in an array are accessed using an index, starting from 0 for the first element.
- Declaration: Arrays are declared using square brackets [] after the data type, specifying the size of the array.
- Memory management: Memory for arrays is allocated statically or dynamically depending on how they are declared.
- Iteration: Loops are commonly used to iterate through array elements for processing or manipulation.

---

- Example from (geeksforgeeks):

``` C++
// C++ Program to demonstrate the working of
// getline(), push_back() and pop_back()

#include <iostream>
#include <string> // for string class
using namespace std;

// Driver Code
int main(){

// Declaring string
string str;

// Taking string input using getline()
getline(cin, str);

// Displaying string
cout << "The initial string is : ";
cout << str << endl;

// Inserting a character
str.push_back('s');

// Displaying string
cout << "The string after push_back operation is : ";
cout << str << endl;

// Deleting a character
str.pop_back();

// Displaying string
cout << "The string after pop_back operation is : ";
cout << str << endl;
return 0;
}
```

## Array Min Nunmber
---

``` C++
void setup(){
Serial.begin(9600);
    int grades [] = {9,5,8,3,2,9,3,1,7};
  int min = grades[0];
  for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    if (grades[i] < min) {
     min = grades[i];
    }
  }
 //writes the min number with a delay
    Serial.println(min);
    delay(500);
    }


void loop(){
}
```

--- 

## üéµüé§Toneüé§üéµ
---

Tone is a function used in C++ to make a sound on a specific pin. To call this function we need to do:

¬¥¬¥¬¥ C++
tone(pinNumber, frecuency, duration);
delay(duration+25);
noTone(pinNumber);
¬¥¬¥¬¥

### Tips for making the song
---
"Int" is a vaariable that ocupies space in the memory, so when we have to define a lot of variables like in the songs, we use something that is called "#define". This "define" is not a variable it's an instuction for the compilator so it doesn't occupy any space in the memory.
