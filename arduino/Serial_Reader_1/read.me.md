The code in the Loop identifies that if we write something, the arduino program will respond by telling us ("You Wirght: "+ whatever we have written).

Then it will go to the void decide and it will respond with ("we are deciding with the input: "+input), and if the input we write is (input=="cook\n"), the code will go to the void section cook.

Then the code will write to us ("we are cooking").
