This code is meant to right "Webi Wabo" the first time, but I have some problems traing to separate the words, I wasn't able to complet with all the requirements that were meant to do.

This code is meant to wright "Webi Wabo", then chage the position of the 2 fierst letters, then it has to change of position the letter A and I of position, and finally change the letter B to a V, from the second part of the Word. And finaly wright to word again with all the changes made previously.

In this final part of the task I wasn't able to code it, the one of changing the B and the V, because I don't know how to.
