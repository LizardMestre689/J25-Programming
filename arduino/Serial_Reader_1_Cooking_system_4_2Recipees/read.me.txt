This code is similar to the previous one.

The things that vary are that now we have added more ingredients to the code, and instead of just creating one dish, it creates 2. One is bread with tomato and the second is rice pudding, the new ingredients that have been added are milk, rice and cinnamon.

The process is the same, the code reads if we have the ingredients and if we have them, it cooks them and creates the dish, and when cooking the dish it subtracts the ingredients used. If we need more of an ingredient, simply write the name of the ingredient and you will get an extra one.

But now we also have an inventory that tells us the ingredients we have available to use.
