Exercice 1
---

The first code was meant to combining Lines 18-31 into one single println() statement, using '+' to concatenate all the items together.

Exercice 2
---

In this code we had to chage the code for it to do a multiplication sign in an arithmetic expression, e.g., x = 5a + 4b. In programming, you need to explicitly provide all the operators, i.e., x = 5*a + 4*b. Try printing the sum of 31 times of number1 and 17 times of number2.

Exercice 3
---

In this code we had to write a program called SumProduct3Numbers, which introduces one more int variable called number3, and assign it an integer value of 77. Compute and print the sum and product of all the three numbers.
