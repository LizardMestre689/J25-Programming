## Exercices 1,2,3: 5/02/2024

---
Exercice 1
---

This code has a variation in Lines 18-31 into one single println() statement, using '+' to concatenate all the items together.

---
Exercice 2
---

In this code we chaged the code for it to do a multiplication sign in an arithmetic expression, e.g., x = 5a + 4b. In programming, you need to explicitly provide all the operators, i.e., x = 5a + 4b. Try printing the sum of 31 times of number1 and 17 times of number2.

---
Exercice 3
---

This code had to write a program called SumProduct3Numbers, which introduces one more int variable called number3, and assign it an integer value of 77. Compute and print the sum and product of all the three numbers.

## While Java 2 Exercices

The first program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 1000 that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7, but not by 15, 21, 35, or 105, and prints the result.

The second program counts the number of leap years between 999 and 2010 (inclusive) and prints each leap year with "AD" appended to it, then it prints the total number of leap years found.

## Circle
---
On the first one we have to create an instance of a circle with default parameter.

On the second one we have to create an instance of a circle with radius 5.

On the third one we have to create an instance of a circle with radius 10 and the color green.

On the fourth one we have to create an instance of a circle with radius -2 and the color greenish.

On the fifth one we have to create an instance of a circle with default radius but colo blue.

## Class Books

---

To create book objects, use the blueprint provided by the Book class. By designating instance variables as private and utilizing public getters and setters to access and modify the book's data, the class leverages data encapsulation. Additionally, it has constructors that may be used to create the object with specific attributes like the author or title, or it can be used with default values.

## OPP findBookByTitle
---

In this exercice we had to change a code that was in HackMd, we had to change the code for it to find a book by it's title and not from it's ISBN.

## MÃ©todo addBook

---

In this code we had to follow this steps to cread the code:

In this case we're going to implement the method addBook(Book b) that will add a book in the first empty position of the array library and return the position (ie the index of the array) at which the book has been added. If it's not possible to fit the book into the library, then it should return -1.

To do that first we need to work on the signature of the method. This is to have clear
a) the access of the method. By default the methods are public unless stated otherwise.
b) the return type (or if there is not): int (since is the index of an array or -1)
c) the name of the method: addBook
d) the parameters (if any) of the method: Book b

And we ended up with a method that adds a book to the library array at the first available position (wherever it finds a "null" slot) and returns the index where it added the book. If the library is full (i.e., there are no "null" slots), it returns "-1" to indicate failure.
