Exercice 2
---

In this code we chaged the code for it to do a multiplication sign in an arithmetic expression, e.g., x = 5a + 4b. In programming, you need to explicitly provide all the operators, i.e., x = 5a + 4b. Try printing the sum of 31 times of number1 and 17 times of number2.

Exercice 3
---

This code had to write a program called SumProduct3Numbers, which introduces one more int variable called number3, and assign it an integer value of 77. Compute and print the sum and product of all the three numbers.

## While Java 2 Exercices

The first program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 1000 that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7, but not by 15, 21, 35, or 105, and prints the result.

The second program counts the number of leap years between 999 and 2010 (inclusive) and prints each leap year with "AD" appended to it, then it prints the total number of leap years found.

## Class Books

---

To create book objects, use the blueprint provided by the Book class. By designating instance variables as private and utilizing public getters and setters to access and modify the book's data, the class leverages data encapsulation. Additionally, it has constructors that may be used to create the object with specific attributes like the author or title, or it can be used with default values.
