## Class Books

---

To create book objects, use the blueprint provided by the Book class. By designating instance variables as private and utilizing public getters and setters to access and modify the book's data, the class leverages data encapsulation. Additionally, it has constructors that may be used to create the object with specific attributes like the author or title, or it can be used with default values.
